      <h1> Etymology </h1>
        <p> While a <em> variety of theories </em>  have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the
            St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning " <em> village </em> "or " <em> settlement </em>
             In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of
             Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);
             [10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada.[10]
